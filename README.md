# Wall Mirror Plotting

Repo containing code and pictures relating to plotting mirrors on my wall.

### Story:
* I moved into a new apartment with lots of wall space
* I wanted to put an array of mirrors on my wall
* I didn't know what design/arrangement I should use to put the mirrors on the wall
* I wrote this R script to plot where to put the mirrors on the wall
* I put the mirrors on the wall
* Now I have mirrors on my wall
